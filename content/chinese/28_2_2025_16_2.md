# Short Story in Chinese  

今天，小明放学回家后，急急忙忙地跑进厨房。他看见妈妈正在做饭，锅里的饭已经煮好了。小明很饿，所以他大声喊道：“妈妈，我饿了！” 妈妈转过身来，微笑着问：“你不是做完作业了吗？怎么这么快就回来了？” 小明低下了头，轻声说：“今天的数学题太难了，我不明白。” 妈妈温柔地拍了拍他的肩膀，说：“别担心，我们一起做吧。” 于是，他们一起坐在餐桌旁，仔细研究每一道题目。最后，小明终于明白了所有的难题，并开心地说：“谢谢妈妈！”

Today, after school, Xiao Ming ran into the kitchen in a hurry. He saw his mother cooking and the rice was already cooked. Xiao Ming was very hungry and shouted, "Mom, I'm starving!" His mother turned around and smiled, asking, "You finished your homework, didn't you? How come you're back so soon?" Xiao Ming lowered his head and softly said, "Today's math problems are too difficult; I don't understand them." His mother gently patted his shoulder and said, "Don't worry, let's do them together."
