# Grammatical Points and Analysis  

## Verb-Object Phrases:  
1. **买了蛋糕、气球和礼物** (mǎi le dàngāo, qìqiú hé lǐwù) - "bought cake, balloons, and gifts"  
   - "买" (mǎi) is a verb, and "蛋糕" (dàngāo), "气球" (qìqiú), and "礼物" (lǐwù) are objects. Verb-object phrases are common in Chinese, especially for actions involving objects.  

2. **关了灯** (guān le dēng) - "turned off the lights"  
   - "关" (guān) is the verb, and "灯" (dēng) is the object. The use of "了" (le) indicates the action is complete.  

## Resultative Complements:  
1. **躲在沙发后面** (duǒ zài shāfā hòumiàn) - "hid behind the sofa"  
   - "躲" (duǒ) is the verb, and "在沙发后面" (zài shāfā hòumiàn) is the complement indicating location.  

2. **灯亮了** (dēng liàng le) - "the lights turned on"  
   - "亮" (liàng) is the resultative complement of the verb "灯" (dēng). The action of turning on results in the lights being bright.  

## Expressing Surprise and Emotion:  
1. **又惊又喜** (yòu jīng yòu xǐ) - "both surprised and happy"  
   - The structure "又...又..." is used to describe two simultaneous feelings or qualities.  

2. **非常感动** (fēicháng gǎndòng) - "very touched"  
   - "非常" (fēicháng) is an adverb used for emphasis, and "感动" (gǎndòng) means "touched" or "moved emotionally."  

## Time Expressions:  
1. **早上七点** (zǎoshang qī diǎn) - "seven in the morning"  
   - Specific time expressions are placed before the verb to indicate when the action happened.  

2. **下午五点** (xiàwǔ wǔ diǎn) - "five in the afternoon"  
   - Similarly, this indicates the time of the action.  

## Sentence Patterns:  
1. **这是我最开心的一天** (zhè shì wǒ zuì kāixīn de yì tiān) - "This is the happiest day of my life."  
   - The structure "最...的" (zuì...de) is used to express the superlative degree, meaning "the most."
