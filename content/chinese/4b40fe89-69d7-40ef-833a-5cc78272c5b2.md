## 汉字  
放学后，丽丽走在回家的路上。突然，她听到路边传来一阵轻轻的叫声。“汪汪！”丽丽低头一看，发现一只小狗躲在草丛里。小狗全身脏兮兮的，看起来很害怕。

丽丽蹲下来，轻声说：“别怕，我不会伤害你。”小狗慢慢地走到丽丽身边，用鼻子嗅了嗅她的手。丽丽摸了摸它的头，说：“你一定是迷路了吧？我们一起去找你的家人，好吗？”

丽丽抱起小狗，走到附近的商店。她问店主：“叔叔，您知道这只小狗是谁家的吗？”店主摇了摇头，说：“我没见过它，可能是流浪狗。”丽丽点点头，决定带小狗回家。

到家后，丽丽给小狗洗了个澡，又拿了一些牛奶给它喝。小狗开心地摇着尾巴。丽丽对妈妈说：“妈妈，我们可以暂时照顾它吗？等找到它的主人，我们再送它回去。”妈妈笑着点头同意了。

晚上，小狗安静地睡在丽丽的床边，似乎很感激丽丽的帮助。丽丽看着它，心里觉得很温暖。

## English Translation  
After school, Lili was walking home. Suddenly, she heard a soft sound coming from the roadside. "Woof woof!" Lili looked down and saw a little puppy hiding in the bushes. The puppy was dirty all over and looked very scared.

Lili squatted down and gently said, "Don’t be afraid, I won’t hurt you." The puppy slowly walked up to Lili and sniffed her hand with its nose. Lili patted its head and said, "You must be lost, right? Let’s go find your family together, okay?"

Lili picked up the puppy and went to a nearby shop. She asked the shopkeeper, "Uncle, do you know whose puppy this is?" The shopkeeper shook his head and said, "I’ve never seen it before. It might be a stray dog." Lili nodded and decided to take the puppy home.

At home, Lili gave the puppy a bath and some milk to drink. The puppy wagged its tail happily. Lili said to her mom, "Mom, can we take care of it for now? Once we find its owner, we’ll return it." Her mom smiled and agreed.

That night, the puppy quietly slept by Lili’s bed, seemingly very grateful for her help. Lili looked at it and felt a warm happiness in her heart.
