## 汉字

在一个炎热的夏天早晨，丽丽和妈妈来到海边。海风轻轻吹拂，阳光照在海面上，波光粼粼，景色很美。丽丽兴奋地四处张望，不一会儿，她远远地看见一个人正缓缓走来。原来走来的是她的奶奶。奶奶戴着一顶草帽，脸上露出温暖的笑容，迎接丽丽。  

丽丽和奶奶一起在沙滩上散步。她们一边走，一边捡贝壳、看海鸥，不时听见海浪拍打岸边的声音。奶奶告诉丽丽，小时候她也常来海边玩耍，这里保留着许多美好的记忆。听了奶奶的话，丽丽觉得心里很高兴。  

中午时分，她们在海边的小店买了冰茶，慢慢享受这愉快的时光。当太阳渐渐西下，海边的天空变成了金黄色，丽丽才依依不舍地和奶奶告别。丽丽心中充满了温暖和快乐，她期待下一次能再与奶奶一同来海边玩。

## English Translation

On a hot summer morning, Lili and her mother went to the beach. The sea breeze blew gently, and the sunlight shone on the rippling sea, making the scene very beautiful. Lili looked around excitedly, and soon she saw someone slowly walking from afar. It turned out that the person was her grandmother. Grandmother wore a straw hat and had a warm smile on her face as she welcomed Lili.

Lili and her grandmother strolled along the sandy shore together. As they walked, they picked up seashells, watched the seagulls, and occasionally listened to the sound of the waves hitting the shore. Grandmother told Lili that when she was little, she often played at the beach, and this place held many wonderful memories. After hearing her grandmother’s words, Lili felt very happy inside.

At noon, they bought iced tea at a small shop by the beach and slowly enjoyed their pleasant time. When the sun gradually set and the sky by the shore turned golden, Lili reluctantly bid farewell to her grandmother. Her heart was full of warmth and joy, and she looked forward to coming to the beach with her grandmother again.

● Resultative Complements: In “慢慢享受” (màn man xiǎngshòu, slowly enjoy) and “依依不舍地告别” (yīyī bù shě de gàobié, bid farewell reluctantly), the adverb or phrase following the verb expresses the manner or result of the action. This structure helps to provide more detail on how an action is performed.
