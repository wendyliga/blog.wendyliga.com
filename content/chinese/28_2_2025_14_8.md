一天，小明去超市买水果。他喜欢吃苹果和香蕉，所以他决定买一些回家。在超市里，他看到很多新鲜的水果，有红红的苹果，黄黄的香蕉，还有绿绿的葡萄。小明选了几个苹果和一串香蕉，然后去排队结账。

在排队的时候，小明发现自己忘了带钱包。他赶紧检查了口袋，但还是找不到。他很着急，不知道该怎么办。排在他后面的一位阿姨看到他的样子，问：“小朋友，你是不是忘了带钱？”小明点点头，说：“是的，阿姨，我忘了带钱包。”

阿姨笑了笑，说：“没关系，我可以帮你付钱。”小明感激地说：“谢谢您，阿姨！我回家一定会把钱还给您。”阿姨摆摆手，说：“不用还了，下次带好钱包就行了。”小明拿着水果，开心地回了家。

回到家后，小明告诉妈妈发生的事情。妈妈说：“这个阿姨真是个好人。以后记得带好钱包，别再忘了。”

# English Translation  

One day, Xiao Ming went to the supermarket to buy some fruit. He liked eating apples and bananas, so he decided to buy some to take home. In the supermarket, he saw many fresh fruits: red apples, yellow bananas, and green grapes. Xiao Ming picked a few apples and a bunch of bananas, then went to line up to pay.

While lining up, Xiao Ming realized he had forgotten his wallet. He quickly checked his pockets but still couldn’t find it. He became very anxious and didn’t know what to do. The auntie behind him in line noticed his expression and asked, “Young man, did you forget to bring money?” Xiao Ming nodded and said, “Yes, auntie, I forgot my wallet.”

The auntie smiled and said, “It’s okay, I can help you pay.” Xiao Ming gratefully said, “Thank you, auntie! I’ll definitely return the money to you when I get home.” The auntie waved her hand and said, “No need to return it, just remember to bring your wallet next time.” Xiao Ming took the fruit and happily went home.

When he got home, Xiao Ming told his mom what had happened. His mom said, “That auntie is really a good person. Remember to bring your wallet next time and don’t forget again.”
