# English Translation

On her way home from school, Lili encountered an unexpected event. She discovered a lost puppy on a small path beside the park. The puppy was thin and looked both hungry and scared. Lili walked over, gently patted its head, and said, “Don’t be afraid, I will help you find your way home.”  
Recalling what her teacher had taught at school, Lili decided to take the puppy to see Uncle Xiao Ming, who lived nearby. The puppy followed Lili, wagging its tail all the way as if it were very happy. After arriving at Uncle Xiao Ming’s house, he immediately said upon seeing the puppy, “This dog might belong to a neighbor, and everyone is very worried about it.”  
Together, Uncle Xiao Ming and Lili went out to post flyers about the missing dog. Soon after, a young woman called, saying that the puppy was hers. Lili and Uncle Xiao Ming transferred the call to her. Not long after, the woman arrived with the puppy at Uncle Xiao Ming's house.  
The woman was very grateful to Lili, praising her kindness and sense of responsibility. Although Lili felt a little sad, she was very happy to see the puppy return to a warm home. She believed that the feeling of doing good is always sweet.
