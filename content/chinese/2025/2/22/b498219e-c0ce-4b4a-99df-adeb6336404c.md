## English Translation

Xiaoming loves his mother very much. Her birthday is coming up, and he wants to give her a beautiful scarf. He went to the store and saw a red scarf that was very pretty, but it cost fifty yuan. Xiaoming opened his wallet, and there were only thirty yuan inside, not enough to buy the scarf.

Xiaoming was a little sad. He thought, "What should I do? I must buy a scarf for my mother!" He went home and saw his toys. Xiaoming has many toys, and he doesn't play with them much anymore. He thought of a good idea: he could sell some of his toys and use the money from selling the toys to buy the scarf!

The next day, Xiaoming set up a small stall at his front door, with his toys on it. He wrote a sign: "Selling toys to buy a birthday gift for Mom!" Many children saw it, and they thought Xiaoming's toys were very pretty and also wanted to buy them.

Xiaoming sold many toys and earned twenty-five yuan. Adding that to his own thirty yuan, he now has fifty-five yuan! He happily ran to the store and bought the red scarf.

On his mother's birthday, Xiaoming gave the scarf to his mother. His mother was very happy, and she said, "Thank you, Xiaoming! This is the best birthday gift I've ever received!" Xiaoming also felt very happy.
