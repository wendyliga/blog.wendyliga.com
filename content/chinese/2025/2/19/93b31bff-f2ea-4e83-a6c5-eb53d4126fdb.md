## English Translation

Lili and her mother were preparing for the Lantern Festival together. The Lantern Festival was approaching, and they needed to put up spring couplets at home.

Mother said, "Lili, shall we write our own spring couplets this year?"

Lili happily said, "That's great! But what should we write on the spring couplets?"

Mother said with a smile, "Spring couplets have many meanings. For example, we can write 'Happy New Year' or 'Good Health'. The important thing is to express our blessings."

Mother took out red paper and a calligraphy brush. She taught Lili how to write characters. Lili studied very seriously. She first wrote "jí" (lucky), and then wrote "xiáng" (auspicious). Although she didn't write very well, she was very happy.

Mother wrote a spring couplet: "Happiness and health, may all your wishes come true". She told Lili, "This spring couplet means that we hope our family will be happy, healthy, and that everything goes smoothly."

Lili put the spring couplets on the door. Looking at the red spring couplets, her heart was full of joy and anticipation. She felt that this year's Lantern Festival would be very wonderful. In the evening, they ate tangyuan together to celebrate the Lantern Festival.
