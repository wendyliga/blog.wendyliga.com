## English Translation

Lulu's mother was very busy because the Spring Festival was coming soon. Her mother said, "Lulu, during the Spring Festival, we need to paste the ‘Fu’ character to make our home more beautiful and bring good luck."

Lulu was very curious. "What does the ‘Fu’ character mean?" she asked.

Her mother smiled and said, "The ‘Fu’ character means happiness, joy, and good luck! We paste the ‘Fu’ character because we hope that everyone can be happy in the new year."

Her mother took out a piece of red paper and a calligraphy brush. "I'll teach you how to write the ‘Fu’ character. Look, first like this, then like that…"

Lulu learned very seriously. She wrote several characters. At first, she didn’t write them very well, but she didn’t give up. Her mother encouraged her, saying, "It's okay, take your time. You'll get better after practicing a few more times."

Lulu continued to practice. Slowly, the ‘Fu’ characters she wrote became more and more beautiful. She pasted the written ‘Fu’ characters on the door, the windows, and the walls.

The house was covered with red ‘Fu’ characters, which looked especially festive. Lulu looked at her own ‘Fu’ characters and felt very happy. She felt that helping her mother prepare for the Spring Festival was very meaningful. This year, Lulu and her mother spent a Spring Festival full of happiness together.
