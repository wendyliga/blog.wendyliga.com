## English Translation
The Lantern Festival was approaching, and Lulu was preparing to celebrate with her family. Mom told Lulu, "We need to make some traditional lanterns to decorate the house." Lulu was very excited. She grabbed some colorful paper and scissors and started making lanterns.

Lulu made a red lantern and even painted beautiful flowers on it. She brought it to the living room, intending to hang it up, but accidentally dropped the lantern on the ground, and it broke. Lulu was very upset and said, "What should I do? The lantern is broken!"

Dad heard this and came over, saying, "Don't worry, Lulu. We can fix it together." Dad fetched some glue, and Lulu carefully glued the torn parts of the lantern back together. Although the lantern looked a bit imperfect, Lulu was happy.

In the evening, the whole family hung the lanterns in the house. The lights lit up, and the house became very beautiful. Mom smiled and said, "Lulu did a great job! This lantern is very special."

On the evening of the Lantern Festival, Lulu looked at the shining lanterns and felt very proud in her heart.
