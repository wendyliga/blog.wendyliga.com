## 汉子  
今天北京下着雨。丽丽撑着一把小伞，走在湿漉漉的街道上。她很着急，因为她昨天丢了一只猫。那只猫的毛是黑白相间，看起来很可爱。丽丽一路边走边找，心里在呼唤：“咪咪，咪咪，你在哪里？”  

走了一会儿，丽丽听到远处有猫叫声。她快步走到一条小巷子，发现角落里躲着一只猫。丽丽仔细一看，发现这正是她失去的猫，咪咪！她赶紧跑过去，把咪咪抱在怀里，高兴地说：“咪咪，我终于找到你了！”  

这时，小明也从巷子口走出来，他看到丽丽和咪咪，问道：“丽丽，你怎么在这大雨天还出来？”丽丽笑着回答：“我找到了咪咪，所以很开心！”  

尽管雨依旧下着，丽丽回到家后，给咪咪准备了温牛奶和猫粮。她们一起坐在温暖的屋子里，看电视，度过了一个难忘的雨天。

## English Translation  
Today, it was raining in Beijing. Lili held a small umbrella and walked along the wet streets. She was very anxious because she had lost her cat yesterday. The cat had black and white fur and looked very cute. Lili walked along while calling out in her heart, “Mimi, Mimi, where are you?”  

After a while, Lili heard the sound of a cat meowing from afar. She quickly walked to a small alley and found a cat hiding in the corner. When she looked carefully, she discovered that this was exactly her lost cat, Mimi! She hurried over, hugged Mimi in her arms, and happily said, “Mimi, I finally found you!”  

At that moment, Xiao Ming also came out from the alley entrance. He saw Lili with Mimi and asked, “Lili, why are you out in this heavy rain?” Lili smiled and replied, “I found Mimi, so I am very happy!”  

Even though it continued to rain, after returning home, Lili prepared warm milk and cat food for Mimi. They sat together in the warm house, watched TV, and spent an unforgettable rainy day.
