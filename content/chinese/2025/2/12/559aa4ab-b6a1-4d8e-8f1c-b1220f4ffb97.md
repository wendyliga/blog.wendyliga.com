# 汉字

一个雨天，小女孩丽丽带着她的小猫咪去了公园。公园里有很多大树和长椅，空气很清新，丽丽觉得很开心。可是突然，天空下起了大雨，丽丽和小猫咪赶紧跑到一棵大树下避雨。

雨越下越大，公园里的路变得湿滑，树叶也在雨中摇晃。丽丽发现她的小猫咪不见了！她很着急，到处喊：“小猫咪！你在哪里？”可是，没有人回答。

丽丽开始四处寻找，她走过长椅，穿过小桥，还看了几棵大树的后面。最后，她听到了一声“喵”的声音。原来小猫咪藏在一张长椅下面，身上的毛湿了，看起来很可怜。

丽丽抱起小猫咪，说：“别害怕，我找到你了！”丽丽把自己的小外套脱下来，盖在小猫咪身上。雨停了，太阳从云后出来了，丽丽和小猫咪走出了公园，回家了。

# English Translation  

On a rainy day, a little girl named Lili took her kitten to the park. The park was full of big trees and benches, and the air was very fresh. Lili felt very happy. But suddenly, the sky started to pour rain, and Lili and her kitten quickly ran under a big tree to take shelter from the rain.

The rain got heavier and heavier, the paths in the park became slippery, and the tree leaves swayed in the rain. Lili realized her kitten was missing! She became very anxious and shouted everywhere, "Kitten! Where are you?" But no one answered.

Lili began to search everywhere. She walked past benches, crossed a small bridge, and even looked behind several big trees. Finally, she heard a "meow." It turned out the kitten was hiding under a bench, its fur wet and looking very pitiful.

Lili picked up the kitten and said, "Don't be afraid, I found you!" Lili took off her little coat and covered it over the kitten. The rain stopped, the sun came out from behind the clouds, and Lili and her kitten walked out of the park and went home.
