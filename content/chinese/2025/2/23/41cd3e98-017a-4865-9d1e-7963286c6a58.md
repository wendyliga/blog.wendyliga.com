## English Translation

Lili went to the temple fair with her parents. There were many people at the temple fair, and it was very lively. Lili saw many fun things and smelled many delicious smells. She saw a stall selling sugar paintings. The sugar paintings had many shapes, including small birds, small dogs, and even dragons!

Lili liked dragons very much, so she said to her mother, "Mom, I want to buy a sugar painting, I want a dragon." Her mother said with a smile, "Okay." Lili used her own pocket money to buy a small dragon sugar painting. The little dragon was very beautiful, and the colors were also very bright. Lili was very happy.

Lili wanted to go home quickly to show her good friend Xiaoming her sugar painting. However, the weather was very hot today, and the sun was very strong. On the way home, the sugar painting began to melt. Lili was very anxious, but there was nothing she could do.

When Lili returned home, her little dragon sugar painting had completely melted, turning into a puddle of sugar water. Lili was a little sad. She thought, "I'll tell Xiaoming about the temple fair tomorrow." Although there was no sugar painting anymore, Lili still remembered the happiness at the temple fair.
