## English Translation

Lili wanted to learn how to ride a bicycle. However, she always fell. She felt it was very difficult and wanted to give up a little.

One day, Lili was practicing riding a bicycle in the park and fell again. She sat on the ground and didn't want to get up. Xiaoming saw her, walked over, and asked, "Lili, what's wrong?"

Lili sadly said, "I can't learn how to ride a bicycle, it's too difficult!"

Xiaoming smiled and said, "Don't be sad. Learning to ride a bicycle is difficult at the beginning. But as long as you practice more, you will definitely learn it. Let me help you!"

Xiaoming helped Lili up and taught her how to keep her balance. He told Lili to look ahead and pedal slowly. Lili listened to Xiaoming's words very hard and practiced bit by bit. Although she still fell, she was much better than before.

After practicing for an afternoon, Lili could finally ride a short distance! She happily said to Xiaoming, "Thank you, Xiaoming! I have learned to ride a bicycle!"

Xiaoming also happily said, "You're welcome! As long as you persevere, you can learn anything!"

From that day on, Lili went to the park to practice riding a bicycle every day. She became more and more skilled and also liked riding a bicycle more and more.
