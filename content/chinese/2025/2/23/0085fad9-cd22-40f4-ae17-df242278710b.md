丽丽学习使用筷子。她觉得筷子很难用。每次想夹面条的时候，面条总是滑下来。她很着急，也很灰心。

小明看见了，走到丽丽旁边，笑着说：“别着急，我来教你。”

小明先告诉丽丽，筷子要怎么拿才正确。他说：“上面的筷子不动，只动下面的筷子。”然后，他一步一步地教丽丽。

丽丽很认真地听，也很努力地练习。刚开始，她还是夹不起面条，但是她没有放弃。小明一直鼓励她，说：“再试一次！你快成功了！”

经过一段时间的练习，丽丽终于可以夹起面条了！她非常开心，大声地说：“我成功了！我学会用筷子了！”

小明也为她感到高兴。他说：“你看，只要努力，就一定能成功。”

丽丽笑着点点头。她觉得，今天不但学会了用筷子，还明白了一个道理：坚持就是胜利。她和小明一起开心地吃着面条。

## English Translation

Lili was learning how to use chopsticks. She thought chopsticks were very difficult to use. Every time she wanted to pick up noodles, the noodles would always slip down. She was very anxious and also discouraged.

Xiaoming saw this and walked to Lili's side, saying with a smile, "Don't worry, I'll teach you."

Xiaoming first told Lili how to hold the chopsticks correctly. He said, "The top chopstick doesn't move, only the bottom chopstick moves." Then, he taught Lili step by step.

Lili listened very carefully and practiced very hard. At first, she still couldn't pick up the noodles, but she didn't give up. Xiaoming kept encouraging her, saying, "Try again! You're almost successful!"

After practicing for a period of time, Lili was finally able to pick up the noodles! She was very happy and said loudly, "I succeeded! I learned how to use chopsticks!"

Xiaoming was also happy for her. He said, "You see, as long as you work hard, you will definitely succeed."

Lili nodded with a smile. She felt that today, she not only learned how to use chopsticks, but also understood a principle: perseverance is victory. She and Xiaoming happily ate noodles together.
