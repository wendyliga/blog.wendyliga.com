## English Translation

Lili was playing in the garden on a sunny morning. Suddenly, she saw a small bird lying on the ground. The bird's wing seemed to be injured. Lili was very worried and carefully picked up the bird. She discovered that the bird's wing was broken.

Lili didn't know what to do, and she thought of her friend Xiaoming. Xiaoming liked small animals very much and knew a lot about animals. Lili ran to Xiaoming's house and told him what had happened.

Xiaoming came to the garden with Lili. Xiaoming looked at the bird and said, "Don't worry, we can help it." Xiaoming taught Lili how to feed the bird water and food. They used a box to make a small home for the bird and placed it in a quiet place.

Every day, Lili and Xiaoming carefully took care of the bird. They fed it water, fed it rice, and also helped it clean the box. After a few days, the bird's wing slowly got better.

One day, the bird started jumping around in the box, as if it wanted to fly. Lili and Xiaoming took the bird to the garden and opened the box. The bird flew up, although it didn't fly high, but it could finally fly! Lili and Xiaoming were very happy. They watched the bird fly towards the blue sky, their hearts filled with joy.
