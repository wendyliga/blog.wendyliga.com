## English Translation

Lili found a small bird in her garden. The bird looked injured, and its wing couldn't move. Lili was very worried, and she carefully took the bird home.

Her friend Xiaoming came over. Lili told Xiaoming about the bird. "We should help it," Xiaoming said. Together they thought of a way. They found a small box and then put some soft cloth inside. They made a makeshift nest.

Lili and Xiaoming gave the bird water and food every day. They were very careful because they knew the bird was very fragile. They hoped the bird could get better soon.

After a few days, the bird's wing slowly could move. Lili and Xiaoming were very happy. They put the nest in the garden and let the bird practice flying.

Finally, one day, the bird successfully flew up. It flew to the tree, then looked back at Lili and Xiaoming, as if saying "Thank you!". Lili and Xiaoming felt very happy; they helped the bird, and the bird could now fly freely.
