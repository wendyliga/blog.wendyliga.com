丽丽在公园里玩的时候，发现了一只小鸟。小鸟的翅膀受伤了，不能飞。它看起来很可怜。丽丽很着急，想帮助它。

她跑去告诉她的朋友小明。“小明，你看！这只小鸟受伤了。”

小明也觉得小鸟很可怜。“我们应该怎么办呢？”他问。

丽丽想了想说：“我们可以给它做一个小小的家，照顾它，等它的翅膀好了，再让它飞走。”

他们找了一个小盒子，放了一些纸和布，做成了一个很舒服的窝。他们每天都给小鸟喂水和米饭。小鸟很喜欢他们，也变得越来越精神。

几天后，小鸟的翅膀慢慢好了。有一天，丽丽和小明把小鸟放在手上，轻轻地放开。小鸟试着飞了一下，然后慢慢地飞走了。丽丽和小明看着小鸟飞走，心里都很高兴。

## English Translation

When Lili was playing in the park, she found a small bird. The bird's wing was injured, and it couldn't fly. It looked very pitiful. Lili was very worried and wanted to help it.

She ran to tell her friend Xiaoming. "Xiaoming, look! This bird is injured."

Xiaoming also felt sorry for the bird. "What should we do?" he asked.

Lili thought for a moment and said, "We can make a small home for it, take care of it, and let it fly away after its wing is healed."

They found a small box, put some paper and cloth in it, and made a very comfortable nest. Every day, they fed the bird water and rice. The bird liked them very much and became more and more energetic.

A few days later, the bird's wing gradually healed. One day, Lili and Xiaoming put the bird on their hands and gently released it. The bird tried to fly, and then slowly flew away. Lili and Xiaoming watched the bird fly away, and they were both very happy.
