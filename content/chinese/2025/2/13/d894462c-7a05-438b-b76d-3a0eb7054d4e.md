## English Translation

In summer, Lìlì went to her grandparents’ farm for vacation. She took the bus to the countryside, feeling very excited. The farm was very big with lush green fields and fruit trees, and the air was fresh. After getting up in the morning, Lìlì quickly ran into the yard to play with the small animals. Her grandfather was planting vegetables in the field, and her grandmother was preparing lunch in the kitchen. Lìlì helped her grandmother pick fruits and helped her grandfather water the plants. She saw a little chick looking for food and a puppy running around in the yard.

At noon, the whole family sat together to enjoy a delicious meal. After lunch, they went for a walk to appreciate the beautiful rural scenery. At that moment, Xiǎomíng also arrived at the farm. He is a neighbor’s child, and he came especially to visit Lìlì today. Xiǎomíng brought some homemade snacks, and they shared a happy time together. In the afternoon, Lìlì and Xiǎomíng cleaned the yard, making it completely neat. As the sun slowly set, Lìlì reluctantly said goodbye to her grandparents and Xiǎomíng. Her heart was full of happiness as she looked forward to her next trip to the farm.
