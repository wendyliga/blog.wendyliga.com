## English Translation  
Lìlì visited her cousin Xiaoming at the temple during the Lantern Festival. Xiaoming was a monk who lived in a temple on the mountain. That day, the sun was shining brightly, and Lìlì set out in the morning. She took a bus for an hour and finally arrived at the temple.  

“Cousin Xiaoming!” Lìlì called out happily, “Happy Lantern Festival!”  
“Little Lìlì, welcome to the temple!” Xiaoming replied with a smile. He showed Lìlì around the temple and even taught her how to light lanterns.  

In the evening, they lit red lanterns together, and the lights were very bright in the dark night. Lìlì said, “Cousin, these lanterns are so beautiful!”  
“Yes,” Xiaoming said, “Every year during the Lantern Festival, we light lanterns to pray for blessings.”  

Later, they walked down the mountain together to watch the lantern parade. The lanterns were colorful and came in various shapes. There were dragons, fish, and rabbits. Lìlì couldn’t take her eyes off them. She said with a smile, “This kind of parade is so interesting!”  

After nine o’clock in the evening, Lìlì said, “Cousin, I have to go home now. Thank you for showing me around.”  
Xiaoming nodded and said, “Be careful on your way home. See you next Lantern Festival!”  

Lìlì got on the bus home, her heart full of joy. She thought, “This year’s Lantern Festival is truly unforgettable!”
