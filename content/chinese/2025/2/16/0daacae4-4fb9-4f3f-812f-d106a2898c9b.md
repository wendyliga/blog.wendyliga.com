## 汉字

情人节那天，丽丽去爷爷奶奶的果园帮忙。果园里种满了苹果树、梨树和橘子树。她的好朋友小明也一起来了。

“丽丽，小明，今天我们要摘橘子！”爷爷开心地说。他们拿着篮子，开始在果园里采摘橘子。橘子又大又甜，丽丽和小明一边摘，一边偷吃了几个。

摘完橘子后，奶奶带他们去厨房，教他们包饺子。奶奶说：“在中国，包饺子是一种重要的节日习俗。”丽丽和小明认真学习，虽然包得不太好看，但他们很高兴。

吃完午饭，爷爷拿出一个小盒子，里面是一对漂亮的红手套。他对丽丽说：“这是送给你的情人节礼物，希望你冬天不冷。”丽丽感动得笑了。

傍晚时分，他们一起坐在果园里看夕阳。丽丽觉得这是她最特别的一次情人节。

## English Translation

On Valentine's Day, Lìlì went to her grandparents' orchard to help. The orchard was full of apple trees, pear trees, and orange trees. Her good friend Xiǎomíng came along as well.

“Lìlì, Xiǎomíng, today we are going to pick oranges!” Grandpa said happily. They carried baskets and began picking oranges in the orchard. The oranges were big and sweet, and Lìlì and Xiǎomíng ate a few while picking.

After finishing the orange harvest, Grandma took them to the kitchen to teach them how to make dumplings. Grandma said, “In China, making dumplings is an important holiday tradition.” Lìlì and Xiǎomíng learned attentively. Even though their dumplings didn’t look very pretty, they were happy.

After lunch, Grandpa took out a small box, which contained a pair of beautiful red gloves. He said to Lìlì, “This is a Valentine's Day gift for you. I hope you won’t feel cold in winter.” Lìlì smiled with gratitude.

In the evening, they sat together in the orchard and watched the sunset. Lìlì felt that this was her most special Valentine's Day ever.
