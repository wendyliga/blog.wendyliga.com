## English Translation  
Xiaoming loves planting flowers. There is a small garden in the backyard of his house. Every morning, he waters the flowers, pulls weeds, and checks the growth of the flowers.  
One day, Xiaoming discovered that the leaves of one flower had turned yellow. He was a little worried, so he went to ask his mother. His mother said, “Maybe you watered it too much, or the sun shone on it for too long.”  
After listening, Xiaoming decided to adjust the timing and amount of watering. He also added a sunshade umbrella to the garden. These measures soon worked, and the leaves of that flower turned green, and it bloomed with beautiful flowers.  
Xiaoming was very happy. He learned how to take care of flowers and liked his garden even more.
