## English Translation

On the day of the Lantern Festival, Xiaoming visited his good friend Xiaoli’s family. They were preparing for the celebration, and Xiaoli’s father taught Xiaoming how to make traditional lanterns. Xiaoming found it very interesting, especially since it was his first time making a lantern by hand.

First, they used bamboo strips to make the frame of the lantern, then wrapped it with red paper. Xiaoming asked, “Why are lanterns always red?” Xiaoli replied with a smile, “Red represents good luck and happiness.” Xiaoming nodded, finding it fascinating.

Next, they painted some beautiful patterns on the lanterns, such as flowers and rabbits. Xiaoli told Xiaoming that this year is the Year of the Rabbit, so painting rabbits is meant to bring more good luck.

In the evening, they hung the finished lanterns in the yard and lit candles inside. Xiaoming looked at the glowing lanterns, his heart filled with joy. He thanked Xiaoli’s family for teaching him so much about traditional culture.

On the night of the Lantern Festival, Xiaoming not only learned how to make lanterns but also felt the warmth and friendship of the holiday.
