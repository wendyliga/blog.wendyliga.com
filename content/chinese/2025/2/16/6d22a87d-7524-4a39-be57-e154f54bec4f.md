## English Translation

After school, Lili was walking home and noticed how lively the street was. It turned out to be the Red Lantern Festival! The streets were full of red lanterns, children were playing games, and adults were chatting. Lili stopped and thought the lanterns were very beautiful.

She saw a stand with many handmade lanterns of different shapes—rabbits, fish, flowers, and even stars. The vendor was an old lady who was smiling warmly as she greeted customers. Lili remembered that Xiaoming’s birthday was next week, and she thought a beautiful lantern would be a very special gift.

Lili asked the old lady, “Excuse me, how much is this lantern?”  
The old lady replied, “This lantern is twenty yuan.”  
Lili nodded, took out her pocket money from her school bag, and bought a star-shaped lantern.

Walking home with the lantern in her hand, Lili felt very happy. She imagined Xiaoming’s smile when he received the gift and felt that she had done something meaningful.

When she got home, Lili carefully placed the lantern on her desk, waiting for Xiaoming’s birthday to give it to him.
