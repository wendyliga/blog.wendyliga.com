# Short Story in Chinese  

今天早上，小明去公园跑步。他看到一个老人在树下坐着，看起来很累。小明走过去问：“您需要帮助吗？”老人笑着说：“谢谢你，我只是休息一下。”  

小明点点头，继续跑步。跑了一圈，他又回到了老人身边。小明发现老人还在原地，脸色有点不好。他担心地问：“您真的没事吗？”老人说：“我有点头晕，可能需要喝点水。”  

小明马上从自己的水壶里倒了一些水给老人。老人喝了水，脸色好了一些。他感激地对小明说：“谢谢你，小伙子。你真是个好人。”  

小明笑了笑，说：“不用谢，这是我应该做的。”然后，他陪着老人等了一会儿，直到老人的家人赶来接他。  

小明看着老人安全离开后，才继续跑步。他觉得今天的早晨特别有意义。

# English Translation  

This morning, Xiaoming went to the park for a run. He saw an old man sitting under a tree, looking very tired. Xiaoming walked over and asked, “Do you need help?” The old man smiled and replied, “Thank you, I’m just resting for a bit.”  

Xiaoming nodded and continued running. After one lap, he returned to the old man’s side. Xiaoming noticed that the old man was still in the same place and looked a little unwell. He asked worriedly, “Are you really okay?” The old man said, “I feel a bit dizzy and might need some water.”  

Xiaoming immediately poured some water from his water bottle for the old man. The old man drank the water, and his complexion improved. He gratefully said to Xiaoming, “Thank you, young man. You’re a good person.”  

Xiaoming smiled and said, “No need to thank me, it’s what I should do.” Then, he stayed with the old man for a while until the old man’s family came to pick him up.  

After watching the old man leave safely, Xiaoming continued his run. He felt that this morning was especially meaningful.
