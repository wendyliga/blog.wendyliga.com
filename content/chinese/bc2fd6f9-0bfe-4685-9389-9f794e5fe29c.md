## 汉字

在除夕夜的晚上，丽丽和家人去公园散步。公园里装饰着红色的灯笼和春联，非常热闹。突然，丽丽听到一阵细小的叫声。她停下来问：“是谁在叫？”那声音很急促，让她想起自己失散的小狗。丽丽决定一定要找到它。

她沿着公园的小路走，来到一个安静的角落。在那里，她遇见了小明。小明也在公园里散步，他看见丽丽神情紧张，就问：“你怎么了？”丽丽告诉他，她的宠物小狗走丢了。小明说：“我们一起找吧。”他们俩仔细地寻找，终于在一棵大树下发现了那只迷路的小狗。小狗正蜷缩在树下，看起来又累又饿。

丽丽轻轻地叫它，小狗醒来后便摇摇尾巴，好像明白了主人的声音。丽丽抱起它，满心欢喜。很快，天边露出晨光，他们一起回家过年。家人们见到小狗找回来了，个个开心极了。那个清晨，所有人都在温馨快乐的气氛中迎接新年的到来。

## English Translation

On New Year’s Eve night, Lìlì and her family went for a walk in the park. The park was decorated with red lanterns and Spring Festival couplets, making it very lively. Suddenly, Lìlì heard a soft barking sound. She stopped and asked, “Who is barking?” The voice was urgent and made her remember her lost puppy. Lìlì decided that she must find it.

She walked along a small path in the park and came to a quiet corner. There, she met Xiǎomíng. Xiǎomíng was also taking a walk in the park; when he saw that Lìlì looked anxious, he asked, “What’s wrong?” Lìlì told him that her pet puppy had gone missing. Xiǎomíng said, “Let’s search together.” The two searched carefully and finally discovered the lost puppy under a big tree. The puppy was curled up under the tree, looking both tired and hungry.

Lìlì gently called it, and after the puppy woke up, it started wagging its tail, as if it recognized its owner’s voice. Lìlì picked it up, feeling extremely delighted. Soon, as dawn broke, they went home together to celebrate the New Year. When her family saw the recovered puppy, everyone was extremely happy. That morning, all of them welcomed the New Year in a warm and joyful atmosphere.
