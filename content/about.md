Hi, my name is **Wendy Liga**. Iâ€™m currently an iOS Developer at [Tokopedia](https://www.tokopedia.com), where I focus on developing and maintaining our [Bazel](https://bazel.build) and compile tools. My work revolves around improving the developer experience by building tools and automation that simplify our workflows. This includes CI/CD pipelines, build tools, IPA size analyzers, and more.

I am honored to win [WWDC20 Scholar Winner](https://www.wwdcscholars.com/s/130CBC3A-A4A0-48FB-AA81-674A41E5C309), which fueled my passion for **Swift** and everything related to iOS development. Iâ€™m an **open-source enthusiast** who enjoys learning new things and sharing knowledge. I frequently write about **iOS development, Swift, and my technical explorations**.

Beyond coding, I love:
- ðŸ’ª workout
- ðŸŽ® Playing games
- ðŸ“– Reading books
- ðŸŽ¬ watching movies
- ðŸ’» Tinkering with my self-hosted Linux server
- ðŸ¤– Exploring local LLMs and AI agents

Iâ€™m also passionate about **Chinese language and culture**. Iâ€™m currently learning **Mandarin** using Duolingo, and I watch Chinese-language content creators on YouTube to accelerate my learning. To make learning more interactive, I even built an **AI-powered Chinese story generator**, which I host at [wendyliga.com/chinese](https://www.wendyliga.com/chinese). In the future, I plan to visit China to immerse myself in the language and culture.
