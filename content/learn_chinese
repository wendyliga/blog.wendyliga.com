# Short Story in Chinese  

在一个小村子里，有一个叫小明的男孩。他很喜欢动物，尤其是狗。他家里有一只小狗，名字叫大黄。大黄是一只聪明又活泼的狗，每天陪着小明玩。  

一天，小明带着大黄去河边玩。他们发现了一只小鸟躺在地上，好像受伤了。小明小心地把小鸟捧起来，大黄在旁边看着，好像也很担心。  

小明对大黄说：“我们把小鸟带回家照顾吧！”大黄摇了摇尾巴，好像同意了。  

回到家，小明用妈妈给的药水给小鸟擦伤口。他还给小鸟做了一个小窝。几天后，小鸟的伤好了，也变得很有精神。  

一天早上，小明打开窗户，小鸟飞了出去。小明有点舍不得，但他知道，小鸟应该回到天空中去。  

从那以后，小明和大黄每天都会去河边，希望再次见到那只小鸟。虽然他们没有再见到它，但小明相信，小鸟一定在蓝天上飞得很开心。

# English Translation   

In a small village, there was a boy named Xiaoming. He really liked animals, especially dogs. He had a dog at home named Dahuang. Dahuang was a clever and energetic dog who played with Xiaoming every day.  

One day, Xiaoming took Dahuang to the riverside to play. They found a little bird lying on the ground, seemingly injured. Xiaoming carefully picked up the bird, and Dahuang watched from the side, looking worried too.  

Xiaoming said to Dahuang, "Let's take the bird home and take care of it!" Dahuang wagged his tail, as if he agreed.  

Back home, Xiaoming used the medicine his mom gave him to clean the bird's wound. He also made a little nest for the bird. A few days later, the bird healed and became energetic again.  

One morning, Xiaoming opened the window, and the bird flew away. Xiaoming was a little reluctant, but he knew the bird should return to the sky.  

After that, Xiaoming and Dahuang went to the riverside every day, hoping to see the bird again. Although they never saw it again, Xiaoming believed that the bird was flying happily in the blue sky.
