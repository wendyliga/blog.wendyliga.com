# Short Story in Chinese  

昨天晚上，小明在家学习。他的妈妈对他说：“小明，今天你学习得很认真！”小明听了很高兴。他说：“妈妈，我想努力学习，考一个好成绩。”  
妈妈点头说：“好孩子，加油！不过也要注意身体，别学得太晚。”  

小明学到十点半，觉得有点累了。他站起来，伸了个懒腰，然后去厨房喝水。他发现桌子上有一盘水果，就拿了一些吃。他心想：“妈妈总是为我准备这么多好吃的东西，我一定要更努力。”  

吃完水果后，小明回到书桌前，继续看书。到十一点，他看完了今天的功课。他站起来，关掉灯，对自己说：“今天的任务完成了，可以安心睡觉了。”

# English Translation  

Last night, Xiaoming was studying at home. His mom said to him, "Xiaoming, you studied very seriously today!" Xiaoming was very happy to hear that. He said, "Mom, I want to work hard and get good grades."  
His mom nodded and said, "Good child, keep it up! But also take care of your health, and don’t study too late."  

Xiaoming studied until 10:30 and felt a little tired. He stood up, stretched, and then went to the kitchen to drink water. He saw a plate of fruit on the table and took some to eat. He thought, "Mom always prepares so many delicious things for me. I must work even harder."  

After eating the fruit, Xiaoming returned to his desk and continued studying. By 11:00, he had finished his homework for the day. He stood up, turned off the light, and said to himself, "Today's tasks are done. I can sleep soundly now."
