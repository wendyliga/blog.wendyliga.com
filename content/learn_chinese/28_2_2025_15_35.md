# Short Story in Chinese  

从前有一个小男孩，他叫小明。他很喜欢动物，特别是狗。一天，小明在公园里看到了一只流浪狗。这只狗看起来又饿又累，身上很脏。

小明心想：“我应该帮它！”于是，他跑回家，拿了一些吃的和一条旧毛巾，再回到公园。小明慢慢地靠近狗，把食物放在地上，狗小心地闻了闻，然后开始吃。

吃完后，小明用毛巾帮狗擦干净。那只狗摇了摇尾巴，好像在说“谢谢”。小明很高兴，他决定带狗回家。妈妈看到后，虽然有点惊讶，但还是同意了。她说：“你要负责照顾它哦！”

从那天起，小明每天给狗喂食，还带它去散步。他给狗取了一个名字，叫“毛毛”。毛毛也变得越来越健康、越来越快乐。小明和毛毛成了最好的朋友。

# English Translation  

Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Xiaoming. He loved animals, especially dogs. One day, Xiaoming saw a stray dog in the park. This dog looked hungry and tired, and it was very dirty.  

Xiaoming thought to himself, “I should help it!” So, he ran home, grabbed some food and an old towel, and went back to the park. Xiaoming slowly approached the dog and placed the food on the ground. The dog carefully sniffed it and then started eating.  

After the dog finished eating, Xiaoming used the towel to clean it up. The dog wagged its tail as if to say “thank you.” Xiaoming was very happy and decided to take the dog home. When his mom saw it, she was a little surprised but agreed. She said, “You have to take care of it, okay?”  

From that day on, Xiaoming fed the dog every day and took it for walks. He gave the dog a name: “Maomao.” Maomao became healthier and happier. Xiaoming and Maomao became the best of friends.
